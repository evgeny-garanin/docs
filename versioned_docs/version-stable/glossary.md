**Address** - A unqiue string characters.

**Ack** - Short for "acknowledgement". 

**Blockchain** - A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks

**[Bonding](https://blog.nymtech.net/bonding-vs-delegated-staking-in-nym-f11d7adceec3)** - A action for node operators to bond thier mix node or gateway to their Nym Wallet.

**Coconut** - A distributed cryptographic signing scheme providing a high degree of privacy for its users.

**CLI** - A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer.

**Credentials** - Unique values that prove the legitimacy of a user or individual.

**Centralisation** - Refers to the The concentration of control of an activity or organisation under a single authority

**Delegating NYM** - Similiar to bonding but by non operators and as a proof of their trust on a node operator providing a good quality of service 

**Decentralisation** - Refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralised entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network.

**Encryption** - The process of encoding information.

**[Gateways](https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5)** - The entrance to the mixnet that encrypted packets must pass through before being forwarded to mixnodes. They also act as a sort of mailbox for messages.

**Metadata** - A set of data that describes and gives information about other data such IP addresses, device types, geolocations etc.

**Mixnet** - Routing protocols that create hard-to-trace communications by using a chain of proxy servers known as mixes which take in messages from multiple senders, shuffle them, and send them back out in random order to the next destination.

**[Mix Nodes](https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnodes-deep-dive-d2b91917f097)** - A individual node within the mixnet where network traffic passes through as part of the infrastucture on the Nym Mixnet

**Nym** - in-text name of the organisation

**NYM** - Natively distributed token 

**Nym Wallet** - The Nym Wallet handles all things regarding handling Nym Tokens in relation to your Nym Node. It is a GUI application that can be downloaded and run on your machine.

**Nym Technologies SA** - Official company name

**Nyx** - a CosmWasm-enabled blockchain smart contracts platform that functions as the backbone of Nym network, used to keep track and provide history of the NYM token's transactions.

**Payload** - The carrying capacity of a packet or other transmission data unit.

**Pledge** - the amount of tokens that are put up by node operators on their nodes as their commitment to provide good quality of service and insure against future bad behaviour.

**Proof-of-Mixing** - The rewarding of NYM tokens based on good quality of service carried out by node operators.

**Public Key** - A large numerical value that is used to encrypt data

**Sphinx** - A cryptographic message format used to relay anonymised messages within a mix netowrks, lightning nextworks and etc.

**[Socks5](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/quickstart/socks5/)** - An Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server.

**[Validators](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/validators/)** - Secure the network with a staking token, defending the network from attacks.

**Zero Knowledge Proofs** - A Cryptographic techniques that make it possible to prove something to be true without having to reveal the evidence.
