:::note
The Nym Socks5 Client was built in the [building nym](/docs/next/run-nym-nodes/build-nym/) section. If you haven't yet built Nym and want to run the code on this page, go there first.
:::

You can check that your binaries are properly compiled with:

```
./nym-socks5-client --help
```

Which should return a list of all avaliable commands:

```

      _ __  _   _ _ __ ___
     | '_ \| | | | '_ \ _ \
     | | | | |_| | | | | | |
     |_| |_|\__, |_| |_| |_|
            |___/

             (socks5 proxy - version 1.0.0-rc.1)

    
Nym Socks5 Proxy 1.0.0-rc.1
Nymtech
A Socks5 localhost proxy that converts incoming messages to Sphinx and sends them to a Nym address

USAGE:
    nym-socks5-client [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    init       Initialise a Nym client. Do this first!
    run        Run the Nym client with provided configuration client optionally overriding set parameters
    upgrade    Try to upgrade the client

```

You can check the necessary parameters for the available commands by running:

```
./nym-client <command> --help 
```

### Initialising a new client instance

Before you can use the client, you need to initalise a new instance of it, which can be done with the following command:

```
nym-socks5-client init --id <id> --provider <provider>
```

The `--id` in the example above is a local identifier so that you can name your clients; it is **never** transmitted over the network.

The `--provider` field needs to be filled with the Nym address of a Network Requester that can make network requests on your behalf. If you can't find one from the community, you'll have to [run your own](/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/). A nicer way of discovering public Service Providers is incoming, but at the moment just ask around in community channels and someone will give you an address to use. 

Users who have `eth` features enabled will have to add several flags to this command in order to initialise their client: 

```
nym-socks5-client init --eth_endpoint <eth_endpoint> --eth_private_key <eth_private_key> --id <id> --provider <provider>
```
### Running the socks5 client

You can run the initalised client by doing this:

```
nym-socks5-client run --id <id>
```

### Using the socks5 client

This will start up a SOCKS5 proxy on your local machine, at `localhost:1080`. You can now route application traffic through the Nym mixnet! 

To have a look at examples of how to attach some existing applications to your client, please see the [Use External Apps](/docs/stable/use-external-apps/) section.
