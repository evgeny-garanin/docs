**[Address](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/addresses-in-nym/)** - A unique string of characters that is generated and stored in its won public/private keypair locally.

**[Ack](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/architecture/traffic-flow/#acks)** - Short for "acknowledgement". 

**[Blockchain](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/smart-contracts/overview/)** - A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks.

**[Coconut](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/coconut/)** - A distributed cryptographic signing scheme providing a high degree of privacy for its users.

**[CLI](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/nym-cli/)** - A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer.

**Credentials** - Unique values that prove the legitimacy of a user or individual.

**Centralisation** - Refers to the concentration of control of an activity or organisation under a single authority.

**Delegating NYM** - Similar to bonding but by non-operators and as proof of their trust in a node operator providing a good quality of service. 

**Decentralisation** - Refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralised entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network.

**Encryption** - The process of encoding information.

**[Gateways](https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5)** - The entrance to the mixnet that encrypted packets must pass through before being forwarded to mix nodes. They also act as a sort of mailbox for messages.

**[Gateway Bonding](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways/#bonding-your-gateway)** - A action for node operators to bond their gateway to their Nym Wallet.

**Metadata** - A set of data that describes and gives information about other data such as IP addresses, device types, geolocations etc.

**[Mixnet](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/architecture/traffic-flow/)** - Routing protocols that create hard-to-trace communications by using a chain of proxy servers known as mixes which take in messages from multiple senders, shuffle them, and send them back out in random order to the next destination.

**[Mix Nodes](https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnodes-deep-dive-d2b91917f097)** - A individual node within the mixnet where network traffic passes through as part of the infrastructure on the Nym Mixnet.

**[Mix node Bonding](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/mixnodes/#bonding-your-mix-node)** - A action for node operators to bond their mix node to their Nym Wallet.

**Nym** - The in-text name of the organisation.

**[NYM](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/nym-cli/#send-tokens-to-an-account)** - Natively distributed token. 

**[Nym Wallet](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/wallet/)** - The Nym Wallet handles all things regarding handling Nym Tokens about your Nym Node. It is a GUI application that can be downloaded and run on your machine.

**[Nym Technologies SA](https://nymtech.net)** - The official company name.

**[Nyx](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/payment-integration-overview/)** - A CosmWasm-enabled blockchain smart contracts platform that functions as the backbone of the Nym network, used to keep track and provide the history of the NYM token's transactions.

**Payload** - The carrying capacity of a packet or other transmission data unit.

**Pledge** - The number of tokens that are put up by node operators on their nodes as their commitment to provide good quality of service and insure against future bad behaviour.

**Proof-of-Mixing** - The reward of NYM tokens is based on the good quality of service carried out by node operators.

**Public Key** - A large numerical value that is used to encrypt data.

**Sphinx** - A cryptographic message format used to relay anonymised messages within a mix of networks, lightning networks, etc.

**[Socks5](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/quickstart/socks5/)** - An Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server.

**[Validators](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/validators/)** - Secure the network with a staking token, defending the network from attacks.

**Zero Knowledge Proofs** - Cryptographic techniques that make it possible to prove something to be true without having to reveal the evidence.
