title: Version Compatibility Table
---

There are numerous components to Nym which are increasingly released (semi)independently of one another. 

Whilst in general it recommended to be running the most recent version of any software, if you cannot do that for whatever reason this table will tell you which versions of different components are mutually compatible with the most up to date version of the platform code running on Mainnet and the Sandbox testnet.
