title: Software Compatibility Table
---

There are numerous components to Nym, new releases of which are released at different times. 

Whilst in general it recommended to be running the most recent version of any software, if you cannot do that for whatever reason this table will tell you what software versions are mutually compatible on Mainnet and the Sandbox Testnet. 

## Mainnet

| Platform (clients and nodes) | Wallet | Mixnet contract | NymConnect  | Other |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | --------------- | ----------- | ----- |    
| 1.0.1                        | 1.0.9  | 1.0.?           | 1.0.2       |       | 
| 1.1.0                        |        | 2.0.0           |             |       | 

## Sandbox (coming soon)
