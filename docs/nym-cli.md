This is a CLI tool for interacting with:

* the Nyx blockchain
* the smart contracts for the Mixnet

It provides a convenient wrapper around the nymd client with similar functionality to thenyxd binary for querying the chain or executing smart contract methods.


### Building 
The `nym-cli` binary can be built by running `cargo build --release` in the [/tools/nym-cli](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/tools/nym-cli) directory. 

### Useage 
You can see all available commands with: 

```
./nym-cli --help      
```
