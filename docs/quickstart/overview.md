There are currently two ways to quickly connect existing applications to Nym. 

* Manually with the `nym-socks5-client` binary: this involves using the CLI to set up and run a local socks5 client, which proxies application traffic through the Mixnet. 
* Using the NymConnect GUI (in beta) to proxy Keybase, Electrum, or Telegram traffic through the Mixnet.
